# basicNowSHExpress
This is a project that showcases a basic vercel.json file that although is using "depricated" functionality shows you how to create a regular node express server app hosted on vercel.

Now Vercel (Prior Now.sh) will eventually stop supporting this method and is moving to a "functions" way (which will mean you'll need a use a new way of hosting your projects) but until that happens. you can still use this project
